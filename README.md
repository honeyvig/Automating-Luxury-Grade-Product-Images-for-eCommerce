# Automating-Luxury-Grade-Product-Images-for-eCommerce
We are building a platform designed to generate luxury-grade, high-quality product images for eCommerce sellers, particularly for luxury brands. We're seeking an AI/ML developer to integrate existing AI tools for multi-angle image generation, image enhancement, and background insertion.

Responsibilities:
Integrate pre-built AI tools such as RunwayML, Claid.ai, or DALL-E to transform user-uploaded images into high-definition, multi-angle product photos.
Ensure the AI enhances product details (texture, lighting, color balance), making images suitable for luxury product listings.
Set up functionality for background removal and insertion of lifestyle backgrounds (e.g., marble, wood).
Ensure automated workflows for users to upload product images and download enhanced results seamlessly.
Collaborate with the front-end developer to integrate the AI processes with the user interface.
Requirements:
Strong experience with AI image processing tools like RunwayML, Claid.ai, Pix2Pix, or DALL-E.
Expertise in integrating pre-trained AI models into platforms via APIs.
Experience with image enhancement and background removal tools like Remove.bg.
Familiarity with eCommerce or luxury product photography is a plus.
Ability to ensure high-quality outputs focused on showcasing luxury products (fine textures, lighting, color grading).
Tools You Should Be Familiar With:
RunwayML or Claid.ai for multi-angle generation and high-definition image enhancement.
Remove.bg for background removal.
DALL-E or Stable Diffusion for lifestyle background creation.
API Integration experience with any of these tools to create seamless workflows.
==================
Python-based implementation to integrate AI tools and automate the processing of luxury-grade product images for eCommerce. This solution uses APIs from tools like DALL-E, RunwayML, and Remove.bg to create multi-angle images, enhance their quality, and insert high-end backgrounds.

Features of the Code

    Background Removal:
        Uses Remove.bg API to remove the background from product images.

    Image Enhancement:
        Uses RunwayML API to enhance product image quality, focusing on lighting, texture, and color balance.

    Lifestyle Background Generation:
        Uses DALL-E API to generate high-quality luxury backgrounds (e.g., marble, wood).

    Overlay and Composition:
        Combines the product image with the generated background using Pillow.

    Batch Processing:
        Processes all images in the input folder and outputs results in the organized directory structure.

Setup Instructions

    Install Required Libraries:

    pip install requests pillow

    Obtain API Keys:
        Sign up for Remove.bg, RunwayML, and OpenAI (for DALL-E) to get the API keys.

    Set API Keys:
        Replace the placeholders (your_remove_bg_api_key, your_dall_e_api_key, your_runwayml_api_key) with the respective API keys.

    Prepare Input Images:
        Place product images in the input_images directory.

    Run the Script:
        Execute the script to process all images and save the outputs.

Enhancements

    User Interface:
        Create a front-end using Flask or FastAPI for users to upload and download images.

    Scalability:
        Use cloud services like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions for large-scale processing.

    Real-Time Monitoring:
        Integrate progress monitoring and logs for each step in the workflow.

    Advanced AI Integration:
        Add fine-tuning options for image enhancement and background customization.

This solution ensures high-quality luxury-grade image outputs suitable for eCommerce platforms. Let me know if you need help extending the features!
